The Rossmann drug stores need an accurate sales forecasting model that can help the managers predict their daily sales for the upcoming six weeks. Currently, the sales prediction varies significantly among the individual store managers due to the unique circumstances surrounding each store. The task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the sales for the upcoming six weeks, considering various factors like promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and location. The model should provide a reliable and accurate prediction of the sales for the stores, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation for the company.
Based on the analysis, we can conclude that December month has the highest average sales.

The last day of the month has the highest average sales.

Additionally, StoreType b has the highest average sales for each month.

Built five machine learning models to predict sales, and the Random Forest model gave the highest accuracy of 92% with the least mean squared error. It is worth noting that the linear regression, ridge, lasso, elastic net models and Decision Tree all had an 81 and 84%% accuracy rate, which is also quite good.

In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into the retail sales dataset, and the machine learning models performed well in predicting sales. Future work can involve further analysis of the dataset, incorporating more variables, and exploring alternative machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the models.
